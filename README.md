# EventMaterial

Slides and code from CocoaHeads CPH events

[Copenhagen Cocoa on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/copenhagencocoa)

## For speakers

After the event you can submit your slides or example code in this repo, so attendees can check it out. 

Fork this repository, and place your files in a folder for the event date: `/<date>/<title>/..files here..`. Then make a PR back to this repository. Thanks ðŸ™Œ

For slides it's best to upload them to [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com) and here include a markdown file with a link. You can include additional info about the talk in that markdown file. You can also include a pdf file instead.
